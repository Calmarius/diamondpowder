This is my ice halo simulator. 

COMPILATION

You may use the Code::Blocks projects to compile it, but compilation is easy anyway.

Linux:

Install wxwidgets development files, if everything is installed, you can build the program by compiling the following single source file:
g++ _master.cpp `wx-config --cflags` `wx-config --libs` -o hs

Windows:



Basically the same, but first you need to build wxWidgets for yourself, and 
set the command line argument manually:

g++ -mthreads -D__GNUWIN32__ -D__WXMSW__ -DWXUSINGDLL -DwxUSE_UNICODE -Wno-attributes -Wall  -g -D__WXDEBUG__  -I<wx_widgets_path>\include -I<wx_widgets_path>\lib\gcc_dll\mswud -c _master.cpp -o _master.o
g++ -L<wx_widgets_path>\lib\gcc_dll _master.o   -mthreads  -lwxmsw28ud  -mwindows -o hs.exe

To use it you will also need mingwm10.dll and and the wxwidgets dll you built.


INSTALLATION

It does not need that.

USAGE

- Open the crystal editor editor in the Crystals/Crystal editor menu.
- Generate a hexagonal prism.
- Add the crystal to the display.
- In the main window, review the crystal population in the crystal composition editor.
- Then use the Rendering/Render menu to render the halo display.

FUTURE PLANS

To add: 

- Ability to simulate pyramidal displays
- Ability to use arbitrary shapes loaded from OBJ files.
- Ability to simulate spatial halos.

This is my ice halo simulator. 

COMPILATION

(WIP)

INSTALLATION

It does not need that.

USAGE

- Open the crystal editor editor in the Crystals/Crystal editor menu.
- Generate a hexagonal prism.
- Add the crystal to the display.
- In the main window, review the crystal population in the crystal composition editor.
- Then use the Rendering/Render menu to render the halo display.

FUTURE PLANS

To add: 

- Ability to simulate pyramidal displays
- Ability to use arbitrary shapes loaded from OBJ files.
- Ability to simulate spatial halos.

This is my ice halo simulator. 

COMPILATION

You may use the Code::Blocks projects to compile it, but compilation is easy anyway.

Linux:

Install wxwidgets development files, if everything is installed, you can build the program by compiling the following single source file:
g++ _master.cpp `wx-config --cflags` `wx-config --libs`

Windows:

Basically the Linux way works on Windows too, when using the MinGW toolchain.
On there you will need to build the wxWidgets (as they don't provide precompiled binaries).

Basically all you need is adding the header search path and the wxWidgets link library.

I haven't compiled it from command line on Windows yet.

(WIP)


INSTALLATION

It does not need that.

USAGE

- Open the crystal editor editor in the Crystals/Crystal editor menu.
- Generate a hexagonal prism.
- Add the crystal to the display.
- In the main window, review the crystal population in the crystal composition editor.
- Then use the Rendering/Render menu to render the halo display.

FUTURE PLANS

To add: 

- Ability to simulate pyramidal displays
- Ability to use arbitrary shapes loaded from OBJ files.
- Ability to simulate spatial halos.

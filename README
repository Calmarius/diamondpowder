This is my ice halo simulator. 

COMPILATION

You may use the Code::Blocks projects to compile it, but compilation is easy anyway.

Linux:

Install wxwidgets development files, if everything is installed, you can build the program by compiling the following single source file:
g++ _master.cpp `wx-config --cflags` `wx-config --libs` -o hs

Windows:

If you have MinGW you can build a debug version of it with the following command:

g++ -I<wx_path>/include -I<wx_path>/lib/gcc_dll/mswud -L<wx_path>/lib/gcc_dll -mthreads -mwindows -D__GNUWIN32__ -D__WXMSW__ -DWXUSINGDLL -DwxUSE_UNICODE -g -D__WXDEBUG__ _master.cpp -lwxmsw28ud -o hs.exe

You will need to compile wxWidgets with MinGW before proceed.

Substitute the wxWidgets directory to the <wx_path>. I order to run it, you will need the compiled wxWidgets DLL, and the mingwm10.dll next to executable (the mingw dll is in your system if you installed MinGW).

INSTALLATION

It does not need that.

USAGE

- Open the crystal editor editor in the Crystals/Crystal editor menu.
- Generate a hexagonal prism.
- Add the crystal to the display.
- In the main window, review the crystal population in the crystal composition editor.
- Then use the Rendering/Render menu to render the halo display.

FUTURE PLANS

To add: 

- Ability to simulate pyramidal displays
- Ability to use arbitrary shapes loaded from OBJ files.
- Ability to simulate spatial halos.
